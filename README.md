# discord-bot-builder

This project is a simple Discord bot built with Node.js.

## Setup

Run the following script from the project root to install all dependencies:

```sh
./setup.sh
```

The repository includes a `package.json` file, so the script simply runs
`npm install` (and will create one if it doesn't exist).
